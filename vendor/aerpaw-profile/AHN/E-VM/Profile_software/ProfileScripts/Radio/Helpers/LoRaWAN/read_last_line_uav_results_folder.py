"""
Real-time monitoring of a specified folder for changes, focusing on modifications to files ending with 'vehicleOut.txt'. inside the Results folder.
Using the watchdog library, the script utilizes a custom MyHandler class to handle filesystem events, particularly file modifications.
Within this class, the on_modified method is invoked upon file modification, extracting the most recent line from the modified file.
Auxiliary functions, namely get_last_line and get_last_modified_file, assist in retrieving the last line of a file and determining 
the most recently modified file in a folder, respectively. 
The script operates within a continuous loop, periodically checking for updates every second.
Upon detecting a change, it yields the latest line, ensuring that only new lines are processed.
